// last time: introduced structures
// example was D&D player attributes
// Accessing elements with the dot operator
// also looked at structure pointers, using ->

// This time: more structure practice
// cover:
// strings in structures, the need to use strcpy()

// Linked list code example
// create a short ll
// traverse it and print the data
// insert an element
// delete an element


// then look at structures with two pointers: binary trees.




// For a future lesson:  argc and argv
// talk about arrays of char *
// and demo prog for command-line arguments.
